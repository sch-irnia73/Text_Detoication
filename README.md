To utilize this repository effectively, the first prerequisite is to install all the dependencies specified in the "requirements.txt" file. This file serves as a standardized way of managing project dependencies and is particularly useful when sharing code or deploying applications, as it ensures that all required packages and modules are installed with their respective version numbers.

Once the necessary dependencies are installed, you can execute the code that executes the code contained in the repository's Jupyter notebook 10000-overall-assignment-notebook. 


Alternatively, you can also execute this code that uses the code located in the "src" directory. This directory contains the same code as the notebooks, but it is organized differently. This could be more suitable for users who prefer a traditional code structure, or for those who wish to integrate the code into a larger project.

run command:
python train_model1.py
python predict_model.py



In conclusion, this repository provides multiple avenues for users to leverage the provided code, whether they prefer to work within a Jupyter notebook environment or within a traditional code structure. The "requirements.txt" file ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed, facilitating a smooth and efficient workflow.
